                <h3>Powell's Speech</h3>
                <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently hinted at a possible interest rate cut, citing a "challenging situation" with upside risks to inflation due to tariffs and downside risks to employment. He noted a "curious balance" in the labor market from a slowdown in both labor supply and demand. Powell emphasized that future policy will be data-driven and that the Fed has revised its framework to a more balanced approach</p>

                <h3>Non Farm Payroll</h3>
                <p>The monthly Non-Farm Payrolls report, which measures the number of new jobs created in the US, significantly impacts the dollar. A stronger-than-expected report suggests a healthy and growing economy, which can lead to expectations of higher interest rates and a stronger dollar. Conversely, a weak report signals a slowdown, potentially causing the dollar to weaken as investors anticipate a more cautious approach from the Federal Reserve. This report is a key indicator of consumer spending and overall economic health</p>

                <h3>Geopolitical Events and Global Instability</h3>
                <p>The US dollar is often considered a "safe haven" currency during times of global political or economic turmoil. When there is uncertainty, conflict, or a crisis in other parts of the world, investors tend to move their capital into what they perceive as more stable and liquid assets, such as US Treasury bonds, which increases demand for the dollar. This flight to safety can cause the dollar to strengthen against other currencies, regardless of the US's domestic economic performance</p>

                <h3>Trade Policies and Tariffs</h3>
                <p>Changes in US trade policy, such as the imposition of new tariffs or the negotiation of trade deals, can directly affect the dollar's value. Tariffs on imported goods can make them more expensive, potentially slowing down imports and improving the US trade balance. This can create demand for the dollar as foreign importers need to convert their currency to pay for the goods and associated duties. However, retaliatory tariffs from other countries can disrupt global supply chains and economic growth, creating uncertainty that may also impact the dollar</p>
