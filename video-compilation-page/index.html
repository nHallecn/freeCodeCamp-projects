        <h1>Indication Correction and Continuation</h1>
        <p>Indication, Correction, and Continuation (ICC) strategy is a method for identifying high-probability entries within a trend. A trader first identifies the overall trend's direction (Indication). They then wait for a temporary, counter-trend pullback (Correction) against that main trend. Finally, they enter a trade in the direction of the original trend once price action suggests the pullback is over and the main trend is resuming (Continuation), often using a break of a minor trendline or a key level as a trigger</p>

            <h2>Indication Phase</h2>
            <p>The indication phase involves identifying the overall market trend. This is the foundation of the ICC strategy and requires understanding technical analysis tools like trend lines, moving averages, and momentum indicators.</p>

            <h2>Correction Phase</h2>
            <p>During the correction phase, the market temporarily moves against the established trend. This pullback offers traders an opportunity to enter positions at better prices before the trend continuation</p>

            <h2>Continuation Phase</h2>
            <p>The continuation phase occurs when the original trend resumes after the correction. Traders look for specific price action signals or indicator confirmations to enter trades in the direction of the overall trend</p>
