            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running on a server.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is often used to add interactive effects to web pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience, if you want to work on server-side applications.</li>
                <li>Familiarity with CSS.</li>
                <li>Basic understanding of client-side web technologies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you don't have these skills, you should go back and brush up on them.</p>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
            <p>JavaScript's primary design goals were to provide a scripting language to complement Java's applications and to be a lightweight language for the Web.</p>
            <p>To declare a variable in Java:</p>
            <code>int myNumber = 5;</code>
            <p>While in JavaScript, it's:</p>
            <code>let myNumber = 5;</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Console and type the following simple line of code:</p>
            <code>console.log("Hello World!");</code>
            <p>This prints the message "Hello World!" to the web console. Go ahead and try it yourself.</p>
            <p>The standard convention for an HTML script tag is:</p>
            <code>&lt;script&gt;
  // JavaScript code goes here
&lt;/script&gt;</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</p>
            <p>The three ways to declare a variable are `var`, `let`, and `const`:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using `var`: <code>var x = 42;</code></li>
                <li>Using `let`: <code>let y = 13;</code></li>
                <li>Using `const`: <code>const PI = 3.14;</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is best practice to use `let` and `const` over `var` in modern JavaScript.</p>
